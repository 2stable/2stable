However, the increasing reliance on these platforms also makes them attractive targets for cybercriminals. To safeguard your online presence, enabling Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), particularly through Time-Based One-Time Password (TOTP) methods, is essential.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="what-is-two-factor-authentication-2fa">What is Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)?</h2>
<p>Two-Factor Authentication is a security measure that requires two forms of verification before granting access to an account. Besides your password, you need a temporary code generated by an app on your smartphone. This extra layer of security significantly reduces the chances of unauthorized access, even if your password is compromised.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="why-you-should-enable-2fa-on-social-media">Why You Should Enable 2FA on Social Media</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Enhanced Security:</strong> According to a report by Symantec, 80% of data breaches could be prevented with 2FA. Social media accounts hold a vast amount of personal information, making them prime targets for hackers. Two-factor authentication (2FA) helps protect this valuable data.</li>
  <li><strong>Defense Against Unauthorized Access:</strong> The rise of cyber-attacks and phishing scams makes passwords alone insufficient. Two-factor authentication ensures that your account remains secure even if your password is stolen.</li>
  <li><strong>Mitigates Social Engineering Risks:</strong> Social engineering attacks trick users into revealing their credentials. 2FA adds an additional layer that attackers cannot easily bypass, enhancing overall security.</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="research-highlights-the-importance-of-2fa">Research Highlights the Importance of 2FA</h2>
<p>A study by Google revealed that adding a recovery phone number can block up to 100% of automated bots, 99% of bulk phishing attacks, and 66% of targeted attacks. This underscores the effectiveness of additional security layers, such as 2FA, in protecting user accounts .</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="leveraging-authenticator-apps-for-2fa">Leveraging Authenticator Apps for 2FA</h2>
<p>One of the best ways to implement Two-factor authenticatio (2FA) is through authenticator apps. The <a href="https://authenticator.2stable.com/" target="_blank">Authenticator App by 2Stable</a> is a top-notch option for generating secure TOTP codes.

If you missed it, you can catch up <object><a href="https://2stable.com/blog/all/password-manager/the-storage/">here</a></object>.</p>

<p>Now, let’s discuss another feature: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Shared Groups</code>.<!--more--></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Shared Groups</code> are useful when you need to share passwords, notes, or files safely with others, such as your family or team. It enables everyone to collaborate without concerns about security. Let’s see how <strong>Password Manager by 2Stable</strong> simplifies and secures this process for everyone involved.</p>

<p>When starting a <strong>Shared Group</strong>, it all begins on one members’s device, as we talked about before with a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GEK</code> (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Group Encryption Key</code>). Next up, we need to invite others to join this group. To understand this better, let’s take a closer look at how CloudKit handles sharing.</p>

<p>In <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CloudKit</code>, sharing a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Zone</code> with other members typically requires their email, phone number, or what’s known as a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CloudKitUserID</code>. However, it’s important to note that we intentionally avoid using any information that could compromise your privacy. That’s why we rely on your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CloudKitUserID</code>, which is unique for every app installed on Apple devices. After you have the member’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CloudKitUserID</code>, you can share a <strong>Zone</strong> with them. At this point, it’s better to say that you can invite them to join the shared zone because they also need to accept a special link generated by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CloudKit</code>.</p>

<p>Ok, now that we have a basic understanding of the process, let’s move on. How can we obtain the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CloudKitUserID</code>, and how do we share this specially generated link to accept the invitation?</p>

<p>To start, we need:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The member’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CloudKitUserID</code> to invite them.</li>
  <li>To send a special link to the person we’re inviting so they can join.</li>
</ol>

<p>To get the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CloudKitUserID</code>, we use a method on the device of the person we want to invite. After that, we need to transfer this ID to the admin’s device, so the admin can set up the invitation.</p>

<p>We’ve implemented a solution using a QR code for this process.</p>

<p>To add someone to a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Shared Group</code>, you need to scan or import their Profile QR code. This QR code is located in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Settings</code> -&gt; <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">My Profile</code> section of the <strong>Password Manager by 2Stable</strong> app. The Profile QR Code contains just the right amount of crucial information needed to securely incorporate a new member into the group.</p>

<p>Pseudocode:</p>

<div class="language-swift highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">struct</span> <span class="kt">QRCode</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">let</span> <span class="nv">cloudKitUserID</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">String</span>
    <span class="k">let</span> <span class="nv">name</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">String</span>
    <span class="k">let</span> <span class="nv">publicKey</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">Data</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That’s it. We need the member’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CloudKitUserID</code> to create our invitation, as discussed previously. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">name</code> is used to make the process more user-friendly; you can choose any name you want, and it will appear to the admin when they scan your QR code. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">publicKey</code> is quite interesting; let’s discuss it further below.</p>

<p>Remember, we must send a special link? This link is what the new member clicks to join. We could have used a different method to send this link back, like a new QR code, or we could ask the admin to email it, like you see in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Notes app</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Reminders app</code>. But we decided not to do that. Still, we need to keep the process secure. That’s where the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">publicKey</code> comes in.</p>

<p>Right here, we need to talk about something called an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Invitation</code> struct. We make this on the admin’s device. It includes the group’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GEK</code>, the link we talked about before, and a few other things like the group’s name and icon. This <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Invitation</code> is key to making sure everything a new member needs to join is in one place.</p>

<p>For sending the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Invitation</code> back, we’ve set up a special communication channel using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Firebase</code>. This works through a technique called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PubSub</code>, where every member subscribes to a channel, allowing others to send data to that channel. To ensure security, each user generates a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Profile</code> struct when they first create their <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">VaultStorage</code> (as discussed in the previous article). It’s important to note that although we call it a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Profile</code>, it’s actually just an asymmetric key pair, accompanied by an icon and a chosen name.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To send the invitation link safely, we use a special kind of protection called asymmetric encryption. When someone creates their <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Profile</code>, they get two keys: one is public, and the other is private. We encrypt, or lock, the invitation with the recipient’s public key. This means only their private key can unlock and read the invitation. This way, the invitation stays safe while it’s sent over the internet, and only the person being invited can open it. This method helps keep everything secure, even us at <strong>2Stable</strong> can’t read that invitation, the use of asymmetric encryption ensures that only the intended recipient, with their private key, can unlock and read the invitation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Despite using asymmetric encryption, it’s important to mention that we’ve developed a special login mechanism to authorize access to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Firebase</code>. This is to prevent someone from flooding a channel with unnecessary data. Every time a user logs into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Firebase</code>, which happens when they open the app, they sign a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">challenge</code> generated on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Firebase</code> with their <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PrivateKey</code>. This signature is then verified on the server with the respective <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PublicKey</code>. This ensures that the server can trust the user really possesses the correct <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PrivateKey</code>. This verification process, enabled by the principles of asymmetric cryptography, adds an extra layer of security by confirming user identity and permissions.</p>

<p>Now, we have the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Invitation</code> and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PubSub</code> channel to send the encrypted invitation to the member.</p>

<p>Once the invitation is sent, the invited member receives it through the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PubSub</code> channel. Since the invitation is encrypted using asymmetric encryption, only the intended recipient, with their private key, can unlock and read it. This ensures that the invitation remains secure even while transmitted over the internet.</p>

<p>When the invited member’s device receives the invitation, it decrypts the message using their private key. This uncovers the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CloudKit</code> link and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GEK</code>. With these, the member can create a new <strong>Storage</strong> that uses the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GEK</code> and connects to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Shared Group</code> CloudKit Zone. Also, the invitation’s metadata, like the group icon and name, gives useful details about the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Shared Group</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s important to note that the member has <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">7 days</code> to open the app and accept the invitation. If they don’t do it within this time frame, the invitation will expire, and the process will need to be started over.</p>
</blockquote>

If you missed it, take a moment to check it out <object><a href="https://2stable.com/blog/all/password-manager/the-vault/">here</a></object>.</p>

<p>Now, let’s move on to the next big piece of the puzzle: creating what we call the <strong>Storage</strong>. <!--more-->Think of it as the core place where all your information is stored. It’s not just a regular <strong>database</strong>; it also acts as a <strong>synchronization engine</strong>, built to prioritize offline access. This approach means <strong>Storage</strong> has two main tasks: ensuring your data remains secure and keeping it synchronized across your devices, or with anyone you choose to share it with. And it does all this securely, ensuring that your information is both safe and accessible, whenever you need it, without compromising on privacy or security.</p>

<p>Let’s start with <strong>Storage</strong>’s first responsibility: persisting data. For our app, we picked a database that many developers like, called <a href="https://github.com/realm/realm-swift"><strong>Realm</strong></a> by MongoDB. Why <strong>Realm</strong>, you might ask? It’s because <strong>Realm</strong> is designed for speed and efficiency, making it perfect for mobile applications like ours. Plus, it has robust <strong>encryption</strong> capabilities that work seamlessly with our security model. This means your data is not just stored; it’s stored securely, ensuring that without the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Master Key</code>, your information remains unreadable and safe.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>From the MongoDB website, we learn that <strong>Realm</strong> keeps your data safe using an encryption algorithm called AES-256 + SHA-2. Think of AES-256 as a super-strong lock that only the right key can open. And SHA-2 helps make sure nobody has tampered with your data. This combination makes your information very secure. If you want to know more about how it works, check it out <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/realm/sdk/swift/realm-files/encrypt-a-realm/#overview">here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, let’s talk about the second important job of <strong>Storage</strong>: making sure your data is in sync. In today’s world, it’s super important to have your information available on all your devices or to share it safely with others. <strong>Storage</strong> isn’t just for keeping your data safe; it also makes sure that all your info is updated and in sync, even if you’re not online. When you do get back online, <strong>Storage</strong> automatically updates your info across all your devices or with anyone you’ve decided to share it with. Plus, if you use <strong>iCloud</strong> to store your data, we keep it <strong>encrypted</strong> there too, making sure it’s always protected. This syncing is all about keeping your data safe and under your control, everywhere you go.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You might have noticed the mention of <strong>iCloud</strong> earlier and wondered how it fits into our security model. <strong>iCloud</strong> uses a technology called <strong>CloudKit</strong>, which is Apple’s powerful cloud storage framework. <strong>CloudKit</strong> gives you a secure and private space online that only you can access. This is key for us at <strong>2Stable</strong> because it means your data is stored in a place where we can’t directly access it. We make sure not to store your personal data on our servers; instead, your encrypted information is safely kept within Apple’s <strong>CloudKit</strong>. This method enhances security and ensures that you’re the only one in control of your data.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At this moment, we have all the information needed to dive deeper into how we integrate <strong>Realm</strong> and your <strong>iCloud</strong> storage together using <strong>Storage</strong>.</p>

<p>First, we create four instances of <strong>Storage</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.privateZones</code> (keeps track of your private zones)</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.sharedZones</code> (keeps track of your shared zones)</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.vaults</code> (stores your encrypted <strong>Vault</strong>s)</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.versioning</code> (keeps track of app version, in case you try to sync an old app with a new one)</li>
</ul>

<p>None of them are encrypted.</p>

<p>These <strong>Storage</strong>s don’t store any sensitive information; we primarily use them for organizational purposes.</p>

<p>Next, we create the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">VaultStorage</code>. This <strong>Storage</strong> instance is created with the primary key of the created <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Vault</code> and encrypted with your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Master Key</code>. This key is exactly the size we need, 512 bits (64 bytes).</p>

<p>In <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">VaultStorage</code>, we keep and sync:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Group Encryption Keys</li>
  <li>Profile</li>
  <li>Favorites Primaries</li>
  <li>Autofill Primaries</li>
  <li>Used Primaries</li>
  <li>Shared Settings</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>In general, we keep in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">VaultStorage</code> all data that needs to be synced with your other devices but not with your shared groups.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Regarding the data stored in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">VaultStorage</code>, we have properties such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Favorite</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Autofill</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Used</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Shared Settings</code>. These properties are designed to be shared across the user’s devices but not with their groups. For example, if you mark an item as a favorite, it should not be automatically marked as a favorite for other members of the group.</p>

<p>In our app, users can organize their data into <strong>Groups</strong>. Each group matches a CloudKit Zone. This design has many benefits. CloudKit custom zones can be shared, and we use this feature. But, to keep all safe, we encrypt every object we add to these zones. For this encryption, we use <strong>Group Encryption Keys</strong>, next referred to as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GEKs</code>.</p>

<p>In our app, you have three kinds of groups for your items: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Personal</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Private</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Shared</code>. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Personal</code> group is just for you and can’t be shared, keeping your personal stuff safe from being accidentally shared. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Private</code> group can be shared if you want. Everything in this group is kept in the iCloud of the person who made the group, called the admin. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Shared</code> group is a group someone else shared with you. The stuff in this group is actually in the iCloud of the person who shared it, who is also the admin.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In our current design, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Shared</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Private</code> groups look the same, but they are actually different, as described before. In fact, if you create a new group and haven’t shared it with anyone yet, then this group is considered <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Private</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you create a new <strong>Group</strong>, we generate a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GEK</code> for it. This key is similar to the one we use for the <strong>Vault</strong>, having the same size of 512 bits (64 bytes), but it comes with extra details like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isSharable</code> and more.</p>

<p>Now we create a new instance of <strong>Storage</strong> with the <strong>Group</strong> primary key and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GEK</code>, and this data is persisted in our <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">VaultStorage</code>. This way, you can access the objects in this group when you unlock the app next time.</p>

<p>For <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Shared</code> groups, it works a bit differently. We don’t make a new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GEK</code>; instead, someone shares the key with you. I’ll go into details on how we securely share the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GEK</code> in my next article. But for now, it’s essential to know that this data is safely stored in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">VaultStorage</code> too.</p>

<p>To summarize:</p>
<ol>
  <li>We maintain four unencrypted <strong>Storage</strong> instances for organizational purposes.</li>
  <li>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">VaultStorage</code> is encrypted with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Master Key</code> and syncs exclusively with your devices.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Personal</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Private</code> groups, which you create, have their <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GEKs</code> generated by you. These <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GEKs</code> are securely stored in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">VaultStorage</code>.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Shared Groups</code> are established when someone invites you to join their group. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GEK</code> for these groups is securely shared with you and is also stored in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">VaultStorage</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>In my next article, I’ll explain how we securely share the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GEK</code> of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Shared</code> <strong>Group</strong>s with you. Additionally, I’ll address the purpose of having <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Profile</code> in our <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">VaultStorage</code>. This way, you’ll have a better understanding of how we keep your data safe and secure.

I’ll show you how we use some cool tech to keep your passwords safe and make your online life easier. <!--more--> Expect a deep dive into the technical aspects, complete with links to documentation and source codes. You’ll get a clear picture of how we make sure your passwords are really secure.</p>

<p>So, let’s dive in and see how Password Manager by 2Stable works to keep your online stuff safe.</p>

<h2 id="the-vault">The Vault</h2>

<p>To begin, let’s understand a simple but important idea in digital security:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Encryption is Easy, Key Management is Hard.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This idea is key to how we do things. Here’s a simple look at how we address this in our app.</p>

<p>When you sign up, your first step is to create what we call a <strong>Vault</strong> as you begin using the app. But this <strong>Vault</strong> isn’t just a place to store items; it’s a unique space from which your own encryption key is generated. This encryption key is crucial for securing your information, ensuring that only you can access it. It’s like having a secret formula that guarantees everything in your <strong>Vault</strong> remains secure and accessible only to you.</p>

<p>The first step in creating a <strong>Vault</strong> is to choose a <strong>Password</strong>. This password, often referred to as the <strong>Master Password</strong>.</p>

<p>This <strong>Password</strong> isn’t saved or stored anywhere except in your head. It’s important to remember it, as there are no ways to recover it if forgotten.</p>

<p>After confirming the password, we generate an encryption key, known as the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Master Key</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MK</code>. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Master Key</code> is a random key consisting of 512 bits (64 bytes).</p>

<p>Additionally, we create another key, called the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Intermediate Key</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IK</code>. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Intermediate Key</code> is a random key comprising 256 bits (32 bytes).</p>

<p>Next, we generate a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Salt</code>. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Salt</code> is a 128-bit (16 bytes) random data.</p>

<p>Following this, we perform some manipulations with your <strong>Password</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We trim any whitespaces and newlines.</li>
  <li>We normalize the <strong>Password</strong> using the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsstring/1415417-decomposedstringwithcompatibilit">Unicode Normalization Form KD</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>This normalized <strong>Password</strong> is now referred to as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NP</code>.</p>

<p>At this point, we’re ready to derive the so-called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Derivated Master Password</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DMP</code>. We achieve this by utilizing the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Argon2ID13</code> algorithm along with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NP</code> and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Salt</code>, using a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">minimum memory size</code> of <strong>32 MB</strong>, a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">minimum number of iterations</code> of <strong>20</strong>, and a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">degree of parallelism</code> of <strong>1</strong>. More information about this process can be found <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html#argon2id">here</a>.</p>

<p>Next, we encrypt the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IK</code> with our <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DMP</code> using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xchacha20poly1305ietf</code> and a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Nonce</code> of 192 bits (24 bytes). This encrypted <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IK</code> is denoted as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">EIK</code>. More information about this encryption process can be found <a href="https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/advanced/stream_ciphers/xchacha20">here</a>.</p>

<p>The next step is to encrypt our <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MK</code> with our <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IK</code> using the same <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xchacha20poly1305ietf</code> algorithm. The resulting encrypted <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MK</code> is denoted as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">EMK</code>.</p>

<p>Let’s sum up:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Generate <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Master Key</code> = <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MK</code></li>
  <li>Generate <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Intermediate Key</code> = <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IK</code></li>
  <li>Generate <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Salt</code> = <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Salt</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">trim(Password)</code> = <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Password</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">normalize(Password)</code> = <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NP</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Argon2ID13(NP, Salt, 20, 32*1024*1024, 1)</code> = <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DMP</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xchacha20poly1305ietf(IK, DMP)</code> = <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">EIK</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xchacha20poly1305ietf(MK, IK)</code> = <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">EMK</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Finally, we are ready to create our <strong>Vault</strong> struct, which looks like this in Swift:</p>

<div class="language-swift highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">struct</span> <span class="kt">Vault</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">let</span> <span class="nv">primary</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">String</span>
    <span class="k">let</span> <span class="nv">name</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">String</span>
    <span class="k">let</span> <span class="nv">version</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">UInt64</span>
    <span class="k">let</span> <span class="nv">salt</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">Crypto</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="kt">Kdf</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="kt">Salt</span>
    <span class="k">let</span> <span class="nv">encryptedIntermediateKey</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">Bytes</span>
    <span class="k">let</span> <span class="nv">encryptedMasterKey</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">Bytes</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>We include the version property in case we need to migrate the <strong>Vault</strong> to some other algorithm or parameters.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, we’ve created the <strong>Vault</strong>, and it can be stored on your device. More importantly, this <strong>Vault</strong> is designed to be synced with the user’s <strong>iCloud</strong>. This means you can get back your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Master Key</code> from any of your devices that are connected to the same iCloud account. Just remember your <strong>Password</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Keep in mind</strong> that at this point, your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Master Key</code> is secure as long as you choose a <strong>Strong Password</strong>. We want to emphasize the importance of understanding the risks involved. While we don’t enforce any limitations on <strong>Password</strong> choice, it is crucial that you pick a <strong>strong, unique password</strong> to ensure the security of your Vault and its contents.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why do we need the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Intermediate Key</code>?</p>

<p>When you use your fingerprint or face to unlock your app, it doesn’t make sense to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Argon2ID13</code>, which can be really resource-intensive. For example, in cases like the Autofill Extension, where there’s a limit of only <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">120 MB</code> of memory available, using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Argon2ID13</code> would be too much. So instead, we store the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Intermediate Key</code> in a secure place called the Secure Enclave.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Secure Enclave is a special part of the device’s hardware that’s specifically designed to keep sensitive information safe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the future, we’re thinking about adding a special feature called an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Emergency Kit</code>. It’s like a secret code that you can scan to get into your account if you forget your <strong>Password</strong>. But you don’t really want to include your <strong>Password</strong> in this <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Emergency Kit</code>, in case you want to keep it, like under a rock or in your parents’ safe. Instead, you want to include the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Intermediate Key</code>.</p>

<p>We’ve just gone through the process of how the <strong>Vault</strong> is created in our Password Manager. This is a key part in safeguarding your digital life, ensuring that your sensitive information is well-protected.</p>

<p>Next, I’ll dive into how we use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Master Key</code> in our security setup.</p>

<p>Stay with us as we continue to reveal more about our security measures, designed to keep your information secure while making it easily accessible to you.</p>]]></content><author><name>c128128</name></author><category term="password manager" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, I will try to explain how Password Manager by 2Stable works, with some tech details to help you understand it better.

For all these activities, we need passwords to keep our information safe. But, as we use more and more websites and apps, we end up with lots of passwords to remember. <!--more--> This can be really tough. Plus, if we’re not careful about how we create and keep track of our passwords, we might make it easy for bad people to get into our accounts. That’s where a password manager comes in handy.</p>

<p>A <strong>Password Manager</strong> is like a safe where you can keep all your passwords. It does more than just remember your passwords for you—it helps protect your information on the internet. With all the dangers out there, like hackers trying to steal your information, having a password manager is like having a strong lock on your digital door.</p>

<p>So, why should everyone think about using a password manager? This article will explain the problems with keeping track of lots of passwords by yourself, why it’s risky to not manage them well, and how a password manager can be your best tool against online dangers.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>

<p>Think about how many times you go online every day. For each thing you do, like checking emails, talking to friends, or buying something, you need a password. Now, imagine trying to remember all those passwords. It’s a lot, right? And if you use the same password for everything because it’s easier to remember, there’s a big risk. If someone finds out that one password, they can get into all your accounts. That’s scary!</p>

<p>Some people try to remember their passwords by using really easy ones or writing them down. But these ways aren’t safe. Easy passwords are like weak locks that don’t keep out thieves. Writing them down is risky too. If you lose the paper or someone else sees it, then your passwords aren’t a secret anymore.</p>

<p>Trying to keep passwords complex and unique for every account leads to another common issue: forgetting them. This can lock you out of your own accounts, causing frustration and potentially locking you out of important services.</p>

<p>Because we have so many passwords for so many different things, it’s hard to keep them all safe and remember them. This is the big problem we’re facing today. We need a better way to handle our passwords so we can keep our online stuff safe without driving ourselves crazy trying to remember a million different things.</p>

<p>The truth is, making up strong passwords that are both safe and easy to remember is tough for most of us. We end up falling into a few common traps:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Reusing Passwords</strong>: Using one password for multiple accounts. It’s like having one key for everything you own. If someone gets this key, they can open every lock.</li>
  <li><strong>Choosing Weak Passwords</strong>: Opting for simple, easy-to-remember passwords. These are easy for hackers to guess, like leaving your door unlocked.</li>
  <li><strong>Writing Them Down</strong>: Keeping a physical list of passwords. If someone finds it, they have access to all your accounts.</li>
  <li><strong>Forgetting Them</strong>: Creating complex passwords but then not being able to remember them, which can lock you out of important accounts.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these methods has its own problems, showing us why finding a secure and easier way to manage passwords is so important.</p>

<h2 id="the-solution-handling-passwords-the-right-way">The Solution: Handling Passwords the Right Way</h2>

<p>The best way to keep our online lives safe is not just by using the right tools; it’s by changing how we manage our passwords. Follow these simple steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Always Use Strong, Random Passwords</strong>: For every website or app you use, your password should be a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols. But remember, we’re not very good at coming up with truly random and secure passwords. We often pick passwords that are easy to guess, like using words or numbers that mean something to us.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Never Reuse Passwords</strong>: Using the same password for more than one account is a big no-no. If someone figures out your password for one account, they shouldn’t be able to get into your other accounts with it.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Handling passwords the right way is the key to keeping your digital life secure. It’s about making smart choices every day to protect your online presence.</p>

Have your usual 2FA codes stopped working and been labeled as invalid?</p>

<p>You might think the solution to this account mystery would be as easy to find as a cat video, but unfortunately, it’s a bit more complicated. That’s why we’ve decided to explain what’s happening with your account, how to fix it, and provide you with tips to prevent this from happening again.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="the-role-of-two-factor-authentication-2fa">The Role of Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</h2>
<p>To begin, let me explain what’s happening with your account. When a website requests that we enter a verification code from an authentication app, it’s because a security feature known as <a href="https://authenticator.2stable.com/what-is-2-factor-authentication-and-how-does-it-work/">Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</a> has been enabled on our account with an authentication app. This feature is meant to help us keep our accounts secure, and stop other people from gaining access to it.</p>

<p>When we are the ones setting this security feature, we store a key to our account on the authentication app. With this unique key, the app generates time-sensitive codes, typically every 30 to 60 seconds. From that point on, each time we log into our account, we are required to provide our username, password, and the code generated by the authentication app at that precise moment. This triple-layered approach ensures that it is indeed us who is trying to access the account.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="the-challenge-of-unauthorized-2fa-setup">The Challenge of Unauthorized 2FA Setup</h2>
<p>However, if someone gains unauthorized access to our account and sets up this security feature, pairing our account to their own authentication app, the 2FA codes for our account will only be generated on this person’s device, granting them exclusive access to the codes and our account.</p>

<p>When this happens to us, we can appreciate how well this security feature works. Since we’re the account owners, we’ve tried everything to get back in – resetting passwords and all – but nothing seems to do the trick. We even end up going around in circles on the Help Center website, without any clear answers on why we can’t access our accounts or what we should do to resolve the issue.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="steps-to-fix-the-account-issue">Steps to Fix the Account Issue</h2>
<p>However, now that the issue with the account has been identified, we can proceed to the next step: how to fix this problem. Our following step should involve initiating an Account Recovery Process through the website’s Help Center. Since 2FA is a security feature that can only be enabled or disabled while logged into our account, we will require assistance from Customer Support to regain access to the account.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="initiating-the-account-recovery-process">Initiating the Account Recovery Process</h2>
<p>The Account Recovery Process is designed to help us users regain access to our accounts in situations like this. The processes may vary depending on how the website has set it up. They may involve steps like providing additional account details, previous transactions, or any relevant information that can verify we own the account. In some cases, additional documentation may be required, such as a government-issued ID (as required by Facebook) or a video selfie (as requested by Instagram).</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="varied-account-recovery-procedures">Varied Account Recovery Procedures</h2>
<p>When starting this process on the website, the available choices could differ based on the platform. Just like on Facebook or Instagram, we might find an option, such as picking the ‘Try another way’ alternative while going through the login steps. However, if we can’t find a similar option, we can always head to the Help Center or visit the Customer Support website for help.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="finding-answers-in-the-help-center">Finding Answers in the Help Center</h2>
<p>Once we’re on the Help Center or Customer Support website, we can use the search bar. We should look for topics such as what to do if our account is hacked, how to set up Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), or Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is not working. Additionally, we might want to try searching for issues related to Two-Factor Verification (2FV) or Two-Step Verification (2SV). While you might expect all websites to use the same name for this security feature, it turns out that this is not the case.</p>

<p>However, if we can’t find an answer using the search bar, our next step is to explore different support topics on the website. Usually, the instructions for recovering our account can be found in Security, Passwords, or Logging In sections.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="securing-your-account-after-recovery">Securing Your Account After Recovery</h2>
<p>Once we have found and gone through the Account Recovery Process and managed to regain access to our account, we enter the final stage of securing and protecting our account. There are a couple of essential things for us to remember. Firstly, the hacker most likely already knows our username and password. Secondly, not all websites automatically turn off 2FA when they let us back in. Therefore, the first thing we should do to secure our account is to reset the 2FA security feature.</p>

<p>By doing this, we will deactivate the hackers’ 2FA and then reactivate it using our secure <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1538761576?pt=122171064&amp;ct=2stable.com.iPhone&amp;mt=8">Authenticator App by 2Stable</a>. In the same process, the key to our account also changes. As a result, we will be the only individuals with access to the codes for our account. The Authenticator App will now generate the codes locally on our device, even offline and without needing a telephone network. This approach ensures that our 2FA codes are always accessible to us.</p>

<p>Additionally, if we secure our Authenticator App with a strong password and remain cautious about accessing our online accounts only through trusted websites, we can greatly reduce the risk of falling victim to phishing attacks. These attacks aim to steal our username, password, and 2FA code in mere seconds. By taking these simple steps, the chances of unauthorized access to our login details drop significantly.</p>

<p>By using the Authenticator App, we not only generate the codes necessary to access our accounts but also safeguard our privacy. This app securely stores all of our accounts in our private iCloud account in an encrypted form. Additionally, an authenticator app should offer features that enable us to access our 2FA codes at all times, even if we lose or change our devices. Features such as end-to-end encryption, encrypted backups, private data storage, synchronization, and an easy-to-restore process are the key reasons why the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1538761576?pt=122171064&amp;ct=2stable.com.iPhone&amp;mt=8">Authenticator App by 2Stable</a> allows us to maintain access to our 2FA codes at any time.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="choosing-the-right-authenticator-app">Choosing the Right Authenticator App</h2>
<p>In situations where we encounter unexpected circumstances and lose access to our accounts or our 2FA codes, going through the Account Recovery Process will help us regain access to our accounts. Choosing the appropriate 2FA method, such as opting for a reliable app like <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1538761576?pt=122171064&amp;ct=2stable.com.iPhone&amp;mt=8">Authenticator App by 2Stable</a>, where security, privacy, and easy access seamlessly unite, can significantly enhance our online security experience. Think of the Authenticator App as your private virtual key to access your online world, making your online security simple and safe.</p>]]></content><author><name>Vanessa.H</name></author><category term="authenticator app" /><category term="authenticator" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Have you suddenly been logged out of your account and, for the first time, asked to provide a 6-digit verification code from an authenticator app to regain access?

There are many ways someone can be a victim of hacking as it can come in many shapes and forms. However, there is one that stands out the most for users who are trying to protect their most valued accounts: <strong> Phishing </strong>
<br /></p>

<p>Phishing commonly tricks its victims into giving up their personal details or sensitive data using emails, telephone calls, or text messages resulting in identity theft or financial loss. In many cases, spoof emails are sent, pretending to come from large and recognized organizations or companies, as an excuse to gain private information putting the victim later on in difficult situations like ransomware or credit card fraud.</p>

<p>Phishing has its origin during the mid-’90s carrying its first attacks on AOL Inc, or America Online, an American web portal, and online service provider, which affected a lot of people turning it into what is now a big headache for internet users. The word has been changed and turned to phishing in relation to the group of people, known as “phreaks”, who first planned these scams. As its name suggests it compares internet users to fish as potential victims ready to fall for any traps or baits in the form of emails containing malicious attached files or links to fake websites.</p>

<p><img class="d-block img-fluid my-4 mx-auto rounded shadow" srcset="/assets/img/blog/authenticator/008/hook-phishing-account@1x.webp, /assets/img/blog/authenticator/008/hook-phishing-account@2x.webp 2x" src="/assets/img/blog/authenticator/008/hook-phishing-account@1x.webp" alt="show hook stealing user data" />
<br />
Since its origins phishing has evolved and developed in so many ways to scam Internet users around the world. Before you can protect your accounts against phishing it is important to know how to identify phishing and its different kinds.</p>

<p>Here we have listed some of them:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Spear phishing</strong> This plot typically uses spoof emails from a reliable source to get the victim’s details. The more research has been done on a specific individual the more it increases the chances of that person falling into the trap.</li>
  <li><strong>Whaling</strong> Similar to spear phishing, it targets a senior-level or important individual from a company to steal information and in most cases ask them to transfer large sums of money.</li>
  <li><strong>Smishing</strong> Also known as SMS phishing. Instead of using email to get personal data, phishers attack their victims on their mobile phones by sending text messages.</li>
  <li><strong>Vishing</strong> Sometimes referred to as Voice Phishing, attackers use phone calls to manipulate and convince their victim to give up private information.</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>

<h4 id="real-case">Real Case</h4>
<p>Let’s imagine how would phishing work in a real situation. Let’s say you have been recently hired to be a community manager as part of the Public Relations Department of Facebook. After a certain time, one day you wake up not knowing that hackers targeted Facebook and breached its security system. In the process, hackers manage to stole almost the totality of Facebook’s employee’s credentials related to their work account and personal account. Unfortunately for you, you are one of these people.</p>

<p>In this case, hackers then now have the email address you use for your Instagram personal account. It is at this point that they decide to target you to get the missing information which is your Instagram account password. To do this, they send you an email posing as “Instagram” telling you that someone is trying to access your account without your permission, and must log in at once to change your personal details to prevent it.</p>

<p>Randomly, you open your mail at 1.00 a.m. while watching Stranger Things season 4 finale. So, more focused on what’s happening to Eleven and her friends you don’t pay enough attention to the content of the email, and immediately click on the link provided to change your details. Not aware that this link takes you to a fake Instagram website, you are then asked to type in your credentials (email and password) for your Instagram account. With no hesitation at all, you follow the instructions, voluntarily giving away your credentials, or more specifically your password for hackers to gain access to your Instagram account.</p>

<p>Obviously, it’s not easy for everyone to identify when an email is a scam or fake at first sight, or when a text message is a fraud. It makes it even more difficult if the person being attacked is caught off guard or under stress. But, what would have happened if you had put more attention to the email?</p>

<p>Surely, you would’ve seen some subtle signs enough to tell if a source is reliable or not. These are some red flags to watch out for in case you think you are being targeted:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Sense of urgency</strong> The first and probably the most effective way to trigger someone to share private information. The email you might have received has been written in such ways to awaken emotions in you like a sense of fear, curiosity, or urgency making you act fast without thinking to manipulate you to click a link or open suspicious content.</li>
  <li><strong>Unusual request and timing</strong> If you get an email from Instagram customer support at 3 a.m. in the morning announcing you have won 5,000 $ worth of purchases and should log in to your account immediately to claim it is a big red flag!</li>
  <li><strong>Message style</strong> Take a closer look and check for any obvious spelling and grammar errors. Mails sent from relevant organizations will always ensure any emails sent out are free from spelling and grammar mistakes.</li>
  <li><strong>Hyperlinks / Attachments</strong> Phishing emails posing as Google or Twitch will commonly contain a malicious link or a suspicious attachment. Links will take the victim to a fake domain to get their credentials such as their mail address and password while attachments could infect computers with malware to steal their credentials.</li>
</ul>

<p>This last example about links and domains is the one you should be paying more attention to whenever you get this kind of suspicious email. If we take the same example I mentioned before the sender’s email address supposedly coming from Instagram won’t even match the one Instagram officially use to contact its users but instead will be something like: <span class="text-danger">instagramnoreply@cbcscouting.com<span></span></span></p>

<p>More importantly, if you look closely at the masked link by hovering over it you will also notice that the domain is somehow strange. An example of it can be like the one you can see: <span class="text-danger">http://xyz.instgrm.com/support</span> (<strong>a</strong> is missing)</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4 id="how-to-avoid-phishing">How to avoid Phishing?</h4>
<p><img class="d-block img-fluid my-4 mx-auto rounded shadow" srcset="/assets/img/blog/authenticator/008/how_to_avoid_phishing@1x.webp, /assets/img/blog/authenticator/008/how_to_avoid_phishing@2x.webp 2x" src="/assets/img/blog/authenticator/008/how_to_avoid_phishing@1x.webp" alt="show hook stealing user data" />
<br />
If a phishing attack is not prevented in time, victims can be affected heavily. As a result, in case a target is a single person this can lead to a financial loss like fraudulent charges, loss of important files or other documents in their device, fake social media posts, and ransomware. Similarly, if an organization or a business has been compromised some of its consequences may be the exposure of personal information about staff and customers, future damage to the employer’s reputation, a company’s value decrease, and ransomware.</p>

<p>Avoiding these situations is important. At this point, many of you may be asking: but, how? To this, there is no easy answer, but surely you can take some precautions to avoid being scammed. You can start by using security technologies to fight fishing such as multi-factor authentication or two-factor authentication. 2FA will be an effective way in securing your device from phishing.</p>

<p>As we mentioned in our previous article, <a href="https://authenticator.2stable.com/what-is-2-factor-authentication-and-how-does-it-work/">Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</a> provides your accounts with an extra security layer. What does that mean you say? Mind that, 2FA is a security system that requires a second piece of evidence or token before granting access to your account. This second piece of evidence or token may ask you about “something you know”, “something you have”( a phone), or “something you are” (Face ID or Touch ID). If you have enabled the 2FA feature in your accounts like Twitch or Crypto.com before logging out, the next time you log in, these accounts will ask you to enter your email and password, and once done will ask you to enter the second piece of evidence. Under any possible phishing attack, phishers will have it difficult to gain access to your account for a simple reason. Even if they have your email and password, and try to log in, they will quickly be facing a big challenge which is entering your 2FA token. Since 2FA is something that is unique and only belongs to you, phishers will be pulling their hair out before there’s a chance they can possibly get it.</p>

<p>Authenticator App is a great 2FA tool to secure your accounts. Not only it generates and keeps your codes, based on a Time-Based one Time password (TOTP), but also recently included another great feature. Authenticator possesses to its advantage the possibility of backing up, restoring, and synchronizing all your data with its “Sync &amp; Backup” option that will come in handy whenever you lose or switch to a new device. As for the new feature, Authenticator has added a <a href="https://authenticator.2stable.com/extensions/">Browser Extension</a> to minimize phishing attacks. The Browser’s auto-fill built alerts the user of suspicious domains when it’s completely different from the ones associated with your account.</p>

<p>To give you a practical example, once Browser Extension has been enabled you will see the Authenticator App icon in the top left or right corner of your Menu bar. Upon entering your credentials in your accounts like Facebook or Instagram, these will then ask you to enter your codes, at this point you can prompt Authenticator App to auto-fill your codes by just clicking on it! Et voilà! You’re back in! Worst case scenario, if the website is designed by phishing attackers whenever trying to auto-fill your code it will warn you that the domain is not the same, and so not to be relied on.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h4>
<p>All in all, in situations in which you think your account is compromised, think before acting and avoid getting yourself in trouble. Remember that any renowned website will never ask easily for credentials or sensitive information online. Be sure to never let your guard down and always keep your accounts secured.</p>]]></content><author><name>Kevin Archer</name></author><category term="authenticator app" /><category term="authenticator," /><category term="security" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nowadays, being hacked is one of the dangers that one can fall into while on the Internet.

In this article, we will show you how 2FA works, why it’s important, the different kinds of 2FA, and how to set them up on your various accounts. Let’s get started!</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4 id="what-is-two-factor-authentication2fa">What is Two-Factor Authentication(2FA)?</h4>
<p>Two-factor authentication is an authentication method that requires two pieces of evidence to be granted access to a certain account. 2FA, usually requires information like Password “something you know”, Hardware token or a smartphone “something you have”, and Face ID “something you are”</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4 id="so-how-does-2fa-work-in-real-situations">So how does 2FA work in real situations?</h4>
<p>Let’s say you want to login into your account without two-factor authentication. As a rule, all you need to do is to enter your username and password…and that’s it! Simple right? but it’s also simple for hackers to access your account. Now, let’s imagine you set up Two-Factor Authentication(2FA) for your account. The system or service will ask to enter your username and password followed by another extra factor giving it another layer of security for instance: a temporary number (something you know) or plugging in a security key (something you have). Once this has been confirmed, you will then be granted access to your account, as usual.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4 id="why-is-2fa-important">Why is 2FA important?</h4>
<p>2FA offers an extra layer of security for your accounts. The main mission is to ensure exclusive entry - to make sure that the person trying to log in is yourself. Nowadays, users are even more getting targeted by online threats of all sorts including malware, cameras recording keystrokes, credential stuffing, SIM swaps, brute-force attacks, and large-scale data breaches on organizations. In a few words, a password isn’t enough anymore… and a second factor is a must-have!</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4 id="what-happens-if-someone-gains-access-to-your-account">What happens if someone gains access to your account?</h4>
<p>There’s no need to say that one of the worst scenarios is getting access to your primary email account, as this will allow the hacker to access and reset the password for all your other accounts/services. They might read and delete your emails; make online purchases in your name; steal your digital currency; blackmail or extort you; impersonate you; delete your files and backups; and, if you’re not able to regain access, lock you out of your important accounts forever. But all these undesirable situations could be easily avoided with Two-Factor Authentication(2FA).</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4 id="what-are-the-different-forms-of-two-factor-authentication2fa">What are the different forms of Two-Factor Authentication(2FA)?</h4>
<p>There are a handful of different kinds of 2FA that you should know about their advantages and their disadvantages. Here we will be mentioning the following: SMS Text, Authenticator App, and U2F security keys.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4 id="sms-text">SMS Text</h4>
<p>After identifying your username and password, the server or system will ask you to provide a number through which a final code will be sent by SMS. Yet, beware as these codes expire within a short period of time. Even so, Phone Verification has its disadvantage: SIM SWAP! SIM Swap fraud basically transfers the details of your phone number to another device. It starts with the fraudster trying to gain all kinds of information about the victim which will be then used to contact the victim’s mobile phone provider and request to transfer the victim’s SIM to itself. Once this happens, the victim’s phone will lose connection to the network, and the fraudster will receive all the SMS and voice calls intended for the victim. This allows the fraudster to intercept any one-time passwords sent via text or phone calls and thus gives them access to two-factor authentication methods of accounts (be it their bank accounts, social media accounts, etc.)</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4 id="authenticator-app">Authenticator App</h4>
<p>Two-Factor Authentication using an Authenticator app works similarly to SMS authentication, after, identifying your username and password you will need to enter a unique code generated in Authenticator App. However, the main difference from SMS authentication, the codes are generated based on a Time-Based One-Time Password or (TOTP) on your device, and the codes are not delivered over the mobile network. In other words, hackers can’t intercept the codes as in SMS text. TOTP is usually a 6-code valid for 30 to 90 seconds that has been generated using the value of the (Shared Secret) and system time. Shared Secret is a unique secret key shared between the Authenticator App and the server. The secret key is generated only once, and then both the Authenticator App and the server keep it safely stored on their ends.</p>

<p>Let’s simulate a real case, for example, I want to set up 2FA for my Facebook account. In this case, I will download Authenticator App by 2Stable, once downloaded, I will open it and will tap on “+”, next, I will log in to my Facebook account and set up the 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication). Once enabled, Facebook will generate a QR code with the unique secret key that I need to scan with Authenticator App by 2Stable. Immediately after, Authenticator will start generating codes - even offline - that will be used as the second factor. In other words, I will need to enter the code from Authenticator App by 2Stable every time I would like to log in to my Facebook account. You can find a <a href="https://authenticator.2stable.com/2fa-guides/facebook/">detailed guide</a> on how to set up 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication) for your Facebook account.</p>

<p>Even if the two-factor authentication via Authenticator App is a good choice to secure your accounts it doesn’t mean you’re totally protected from attacks. Your accounts will still be vulnerable to phishing! 
A phishing attack will trick someone into giving away their login credentials with a fake website that looks almost exactly like the login page to an original service. Usually, you will be sent an email to change your password due to suspicious activity on your account. A hacker will provide you with a link to a fake login page for your service, once you enter your login credentials on this phishing page, the hacker’s automated system will grab the login credentials you type in, including your username, password, and 2FA code. Hacker’s computer will then quickly log into your account on their behalf and will then change your password and 2FA codes, locking you out of your own account.</p>

<p>If you want to find more information on how to enable the 2FA for your accounts you can check our <a href="https://authenticator.2stable.com/2fa-guides/">guidelines</a> for the most popular services: Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and others.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4 id="u2f-security-keys">U2F Security Keys</h4>
<p>Another example of Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is U2F security keys. Universal Second Factor (U2F) security keys are small devices you can carry on your keychain and can be used as a second factor. They can only be validated by a single device (or whatever set of security keys you’ve pre-associated with your account). Using a 2F key is as easy as sticking to your device and touching a button.
Whenever a service asks for your second factor, you plug your U2F gadget into your desktop device and tap on its little conductive metal button to prove you are there with the device. The device checks the website URL that you are on and does some cryptographic wizardry to generate a validation code that it then sends back to the website you are trying to log into.</p>

<p>U2F gadget is a good choice and it’s very secure, still, as with all security methods it also has weak sides, in most cases, you can just lose your U2F device or someone can steal it from you. Never forget that it’s a physical device that you always need to take care of.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h4>
<p>All in all, there are several 2FA methods to choose from and you can decide the best option that better suits your needs. Whichever option you pick, most importantly, if you’re reading this you should have your Two-Factor Authenticator running!</p>]]></content><author><name>Kevin Archer</name></author><category term="authenticator app" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) your secret weapon against hackers!

<p>At the moment if you want to access one of your accounts stored in the Authenticator app you first need to unlock the Authenticator vault with biometry (Face ID / Touch ID) or by entering the password. However, when you create Authenticator Widget, you can access your codes directly from your Home Screen.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4 id="how-to-set-up-the-authenticator-widget">How to set up the Authenticator Widget?</h4>

<p>To add Authenticator Widget for your 2FA accounts you need to follow the next steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open <strong>Authenticator</strong> and add at least 1 account.</li>
  <li>From the <strong>Home Screen</strong>, touch and hold an empty area until the apps jiggle.</li>
  <li>Tap the add button <strong>+</strong> in the upper-left corner.</li>
  <li>Scroll down to select Authenticator</li>
  <li>Choose from two widget sizes and tap <strong>Add Widget</strong> <img class="d-block img-fluid my-4 mx-auto" srcset="/assets/img/blog/authenticator/006/widget-iPhone-1.webp, /assets/img/blog/authenticator/006/widget-iPhone-1@2x.webp 2x" src="/assets/img/blog/authenticator/006/widget-iPhone-1.webp" alt="iPhone showing how to add Authenticator widget" /></li>
  <li>Tap on the recently added Authenticator widget.</li>
  <li>Choose the 2FA accounts that you want to be included in Authenticator Widget.</li>
  <li>Finally, tap outside of the Authenticator Widget to exit.<img class="d-block img-fluid my-4 mx-auto" srcset="/assets/img/blog/authenticator/006/widget-iPhone-2.webp, /assets/img/blog/authenticator/006/widget-iPhone-2@2x.webp 2x" src="/assets/img/blog/authenticator/006/widget-iPhone-2.webp" alt="iPhone displaying Authenticator widget" /></li>
</ol>

<p><br />
That’s it, now you can access your codes even faster. Note that the accounts from Authenticator Widget will be stored in the keychain and will be accessible, without entering your password. Please keep in mind that the security of the keychain is managed by the system.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4 id="what-can-be-improved-in-authenticator-widget">What can be improved in Authenticator Widget?</h4>

<p>We have received a lot of suggestions from our users to add a copy action without opening the app, in other words, now when you tap on any code from Authenticator Widget it copies the code and open the app at the same time. We know about this issue and we would like to improve our widget feature, however, we are limited by the iOS &amp; macOS systems. We hope that Apple would fix this issue with Widgets in the upcoming WWDC 2022, so we can finally take Authenticator Widget to a new level.</p>]]></content><author><name>Kevin Archer</name></author><category term="authenticator app" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have developed Authenticator Widget to allow users to access their codes even faster from the device’s Home Screen.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://2stable.com/assets/img/blog/authenticator/006/how-to-add-authenticator-widget-on-your-home-screen.webp" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://2stable.com/assets/img/blog/authenticator/006/how-to-add-authenticator-widget-on-your-home-screen.webp" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>
